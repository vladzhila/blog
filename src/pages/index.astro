    <h1>Vlad Zhila</h1>

    <p>
      My name is Vlad, and I work as a Senior Software Engineer. My professional
      background spans projects in healthcare, security, and web and mobile
      systems, where I’ve been responsible for architecture, service
      integration, performance optimization, and building scalable solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have about 10 years of experience in IT and around 2 years of active
      work with AI tools. I use them mainly for personal productivity: speeding
      up coding, analyzing data, creating technical documentation, and exploring
      new technologies. I became interested in AI because I wanted to increase
      my work efficiency, and I saw how next-generation tools can change the way
      we build software. The main AI-assistant tools I work with are Cursor,
      Claude Code, and Codex.
